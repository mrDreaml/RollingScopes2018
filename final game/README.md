2. The player chooses the spell first. The spell is selected through a modal dialogue. The name and subsequent animation spells - at your discretion. Types of spells are also at your 3. discretion - they can both damage and heal.
4. The player proceeds to the task screen. If successful, the spell is applied; otherwise, the transition to the monster.
5. Monster applies a spell, deals damage to the player.
